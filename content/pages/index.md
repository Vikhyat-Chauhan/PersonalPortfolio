      #### I’m a developer and researcher with a focus on building intelligent,
      data-driven applications using machine learning and AI. My work explores
      the intersection of human signals, embedded systems, and deep learning.
      Currently, I’m researching and developing advanced AI algorithms inspired
      by brain architecture for drones and robotics.
