      Hi, I’m **Vikhyat** — a computer engineer who’s passionate about bringing
      smart ideas to life through a mix of AI, embedded systems, and real-time
      control.


      I first got curious about tech during my undergrad days, when I built a
      quadcopter for solar plant inspections. Tinkering with sensors, control
      algorithms, and deep learning models made me realize how much I enjoy
      working at the intersection of hardware and intelligence.


      Since then, I’ve worn a few different hats — co-founding a tech startup,
      developing real-time AI systems at **GE Healthcare**, and now diving
      deeper into research as a grad student at **Virginia Tech**. Every step
      has been about learning how to build smarter, faster, and more reliable
      systems that can solve real-world problems.


      Right now, I’m especially excited about trajectory prediction for
      autonomous vehicles, machine learning on the edge, and designing scalable
      IoT ecosystems.


      When I'm not coding or running experiments, you’ll usually find me
      exploring new tech trends, optimizing control systems for fun, or
      sketching ideas for my next side project.
